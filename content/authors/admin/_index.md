I am a Professor in the Department of Government, McDonough School of Business, and School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.  

My research focuses on the distributional consequences of globalization. In my books and research articles, I ask why technological innovation, reduced trade barriers, and foreign capital have enabled unprecedented economic prosperity. Yet, the benefits of globalization have been so unequal. I examine how and why this inequality creates political tensions, worsens societal divisions, and drives support for reactionary policies. In all of these works, I look closely at the politics and policies which exacerbate or mitigate these outcomes. My research spans both developed and developing economies, with a greater emphasis on the latter. 

In 2020, I was a recipient of the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship. I have also been awarded the Fulbright-Nehru Foundation Academic Fellowship at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, India, and an International Affairs Fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations at the World Bank.

My primary research and teaching fields include International political economy, International Development, Global governance, Poverty and the world economy, Globalization and redistribution, States and markets, and Democratization.


My most recent book is Democracies in Peril: Taxation and Redistribution in Globalizing Economies, coauthored with Ida Bastiaens (Cambridge University Press 2018).
